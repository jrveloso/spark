## Create an account or use the demo account:

Email: demo@demo.com
Password: demodemo

**Tech used:** Ruby On Rails, Bootstrap

My focus was to create a simple CRUD app using Rails.

## Optimizations

My next steps for improving this project would be to improve the styling the application. I would also add Google Auth for users who prefer that way of authenticating

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how Rails can simplify the process of creating a full stack web application that does everything in CRUD and already provides an MVC structure to boot.
